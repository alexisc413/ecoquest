# EcoQuest
Maximizing micromobility on college campuses.

# Inspiration
Micromobility is growing, but finding the right route can be frustrating. Scooters, eBikes, and public transit often lack a unified system, and safety concerns discourage adoption. EcoQuest simplifies navigation, rewards users for eco-friendly choices, and improves infrastructure through community reports.

# What it does
Finds nearby scooters, eBikes, and bus stops with real-time Apple Maps integration.
Lets users pick the fastest or cheapest route based on real-time traffic and transit schedules.
Crowdsources safety data by allowing users to report potholes, poor lighting, and missing bike lanes.
Gamifies sustainable travel by offering XP and rewards for eco-friendly commutes.
# How we built it
Swift + SwiftUI for iOS development.
Apple Maps (MapKit, CoreLocation) for real-time transit and micromobility tracking.

# Challenges we ran into
Real-time data processing – Handling live updates from multiple APIs.
UI/UX complexity – Ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.
User adoption – Making micromobility a habit through gamification.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully integrated real-time Apple Maps data.
Built a fully functional SwiftUI app with location tracking.
Designed an intuitive UI to simplify micromobility navigation.
# What we learned
Integrating Apple Maps – Managing real-time data from external sources was challenging but rewarding.
Optimizing SwiftUI Performance – Learned better state management and improved UI responsiveness for live location tracking.
Gamification Boosts Engagement – Users responded positively to XP, rewards, and leaderboards, reinforcing habit-building for sustainable transit.
Crowdsourced Safety Data is Powerful – Community reports on infrastructure issues can directly help cities improve bike lanes and transit safety.
Balancing UI Simplicity & Features – Finding the right balance between an intuitive interface and feature depth was crucial for user adoption.
